Use Pythonâ€™s NLTK package along with the corpora:

	Brown,
	Reuters,

to:
1)  obtain the word frequency distribution (after removing all stop words; use the stopwords corpora for that purpose) for BOTH corpora,

2) display a top ten (ranks 1 through 10) words for BOTH corpora on screen (also place them in the table below)

Top 10 words
Brown	Reuters


	

3) generate log(rank) vs log(frequency) plots for the first 1000 (ranks 1 through 1000) words for BOTH corpora (you can use the matplotlib package or some other plotting package / tool). Place BOTH plots in the table below.
