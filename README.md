Use Pythonâ€™s NLTK package along with the corpora:

	Brown,
	Reuters,

to:
1) [10 pts] obtain the word frequency distribution (after removing all stop words; use the stopwords corpora for that purpose) for BOTH corpora,
2) [10 pts] display a top ten (ranks 1 through 10) words for BOTH corpora on screen (also place them in the table below)

Top 10 words
Brown	Reuters


	

3) [15 pts] generate log(rank) vs log(frequency) plots for the first 1000 (ranks 1 through 1000) words for BOTH corpora (you can use the matplotlib package or some other plotting package / tool). Place BOTH plots in the table below.
